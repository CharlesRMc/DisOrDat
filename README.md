In todayâ€™s ever growing peer influence, we here at Dis or Dat decided to kick it up a notch and allow you to get even more opinions regarding everyday life choices. From choices such as wardrobe and food, to bigger life decisions regarding cars and vacation hotspots. Every decision gets easier with your peers approval. 


##Breakdown
